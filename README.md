This project is a landing page that I develop for ANG Trading the company I work, to develop this website I've imported a front-end template and set this project in a Django strucutre

For that, I start a project and an application, separate the HTML code in templates for each section of the website, extrud the settings.py file to save static files in a separate folder, create a superadmin, a database to store some important data of the website, linked the urls and create my views.py to make the connection between my database

The ideia of this project was to facilitate for the company to edit the sections that can change from times to times, for example in the section of services, instead of create a new item in HTML I just create a logic where the admin can do that from the admin django page

The landing page, it's this one bellow

In this project, the first thing done was create a 'base.html' file to serve as a base to all other HTML files, in this 'base.html' I've loaded all the css, 
JavaScript,some icons and images that is commun to all files, the structure was like that:
