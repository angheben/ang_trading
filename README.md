This project is a landing page that I develop for ANG Trading, the company I work, to develop this website I've imported 
a front-end template and set this project in a Django structure.

For that, I start a project and an application, separate the HTML code in templates for each section of the website, 
extruded the settings.py file to save static files in a separate folder, create a superadmin user, a database to store 
some important data of the website, linked the urls and create my views.py to make the connection between my database.

The ideia of this project was to facilitate for the company to edit the sections that can change from times to times, 
for example in the section of services, instead of create a new item in HTML I just create a logic where the admin can do
that from the admin django page.

The database I've used for this project was PostgreSQL that is in the AWS RDS cloud service and the static file is in
AWS S3 instance.

The deployment of this project was made by EC2 instance and the IP of the ubuntu virtual machine where you can access 
the website is .

I'm constantly working on this website and adding new features, but this is what it looks like so far :D
