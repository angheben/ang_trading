In this project, the first thing done was create a 'base.html' file to serve as a base to all other HTML files, in this 'base.html' I've loaded all the css,

After that, I registered some icons in the 'Our Service' template in my database and regoistered some random people in the 'Our Team' template to

In this project I've learn how to extructure a big HTML file in small ones, learn the concept of class based views, how to register icons and thumb images 
in the database to

I hope you like that :D
