This project is a landing page that I develop for ANG Trading the company I work, to develop this website I've imported a front-end template and set this project in a Django strucutre

For that, I start a django project and application, separate the HTML code in templates for each section of the website, extruded the settings.py file to save static files in a separate folder, create a superadmin, a database to store some important data of the website, linked the urls and create my views.py to make the connection between my database

The idea of this project was to facilitate for the company to edit the sections that can change from times to times, for example in the section of services, instead of create a new item in HTML I just create a logic where the admin can do that from the admin django page

I also connect this project in a AWS RDS to store relational data and in a AWS S3 to store static files

The deployment was made in AWS EC2 with an ubuntu engine, the IP of this service where you can access the website is this one 

And finally this is the result :D
